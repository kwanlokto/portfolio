    title: "What Does 'Pragmatic' Actually Mean?",
    content: `Being pragmatic isn't about taking shortcuts. It's about making smart tradeoffs. You write code that works *and* lasts. You solve real problems instead of just flexing your technical chops. You get better over time, and you take ownership of what you ship.

The book frames software development as something you can practice and master, like woodworking or cooking. Not something you just "do."`,
  },
  {
    title: "Own Your Code",
    subtitle: "The Big Ideas",
    content: `Early on, the book drops this line: "Don't live with broken windows." Meaning: if you see messy code, unclear docs, or failing tests — fix them. Or at least don't ignore them. Little problems pile up into technical debt that'll crush you later.

Good developers don't just write code. They own it. They own their mistakes and their growth too.`,
  },
  {
    title: "DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself",
    content: `You've probably heard this one. But it's not just about copy-pasting. It's about duplicated *logic*, duplicated *knowledge*, duplicated *assumptions*. When something needs to change, you want to change it in exactly one place.

DRY makes your codebase cleaner, easier to maintain, and less bug-prone.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Design for Change",
    content: `Here's the thing: requirements change. Teams grow. Systems scale. So instead of optimizing for today's features, optimize for flexibility.

Good code has clear boundaries. It's loosely coupled. You can modify one part without breaking three others. The book hammers this home — being clever is fine, but being flexible is better.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Master Your Tools",
    content: `Pragmatic programmers really understand their editors, debuggers, shells, and version control. They automate repetitive stuff. They learn the shortcuts. Saving a few seconds dozens of times a day? That compounds into real productivity.

The book pushes you to invest time in your tools. It pays off.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Test as You Go",
    content: `Testing isn't something you tack on at the end. It's part of working through the problem. Write tests alongside your code. Automate where you can. Treat tests like living documentation.

This lines up perfectly with modern practices like TDD and CI/CD, which didn't even exist when the first edition came out.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Communicate Like It Matters",
    content: `Software isn't just code. It's people. You need to write clear docs, ask good questions, and explain tradeoffs to non-technical stakeholders. Communication is a technical skill.

A lot of projects fail because of misunderstandings, not bad engineering.`,
  },
